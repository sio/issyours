## Third-party notices

- Issyours depends on [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) static site generator
  (open source under AGPLv3)
- Default theme for Issyours is

## Explanation of licensing decision

Issyours imports some Pelican classes and relies on their implementation. I
think that constitutes a derivative work and therefore requires Issyours to be
licensed under AGPL because Pelican is licensed under AGPL.
