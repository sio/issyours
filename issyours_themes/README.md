# Expanding Pelican themes for compatibility with Issyours

This directory contains extra templates for adding Issyours support to
existing Pelican themes.

Use `THEME_TEMPLATES_OVERRIDES` to tell Pelican which extra templates to use.
See [Pelican documentation] for more information.

Currently the following themes are supported:

- [Alchemy](https://github.com/nairobilug/pelican-alchemy)
    - TODO: Explain that provided templates require overriding theme CSS
